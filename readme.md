### Rules to be followed while writing sample app:

- You are allowed to use use third party library for network services only.
- You should be able to showcase your knowledge on View Model android

##### architecture through your sample app (Ref:

##### https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)

- Sample program should have unit test written for the the application. It is not

##### expected to have 100% code coverage, however, enough test cases added to

##### showcase your skill on unit testing.

- Through your code you should be able to showcase your knowledge on Android

##### Data Binding concepts (Ref: https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-
